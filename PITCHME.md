#### The React Native Decision

Experience with Golang on Mobile

Surveying Future Users

---

#### Lesson 0

*Donâ€™t decide on using a cross-platform mobile technology until you know who is going to be using the app*

---

#### What Distinguishes React Native

Know FE Web? React? Great.

Open Source, Big Community

The Real Deal: A Native Experience

Code Push

Better Than Golang on Mobile

---

#### Achieving a Native Experience

Your Phone is Running React with JavaScript Core

JavaScript is Doing the Business Logic

React Problem: Need to Sync Virtual DOM to UIKit, Asynchronously

The Solution: A Message Queue

---

#### The Bridge: JavaScript Communicating with Native

Events Registered in Native Code (touches, network calls, etc.)

Asynchronous API (to Native), Batched Messages, Exchange Serializable Messages

Native -(JSON)-> JavaScript -(JSON)-> Native -> Execute Commands & Update UI

JS Wrappers: Take Method and Module Name, Arguments, and Add it To Message Queue

          <Sae
            label={'Search for a Product'}
            height={38}

#### Ignite

Reusable Components

Redux: Sagas, Reducers, Actions

Note:
Ask how much they know about this pattern

#### Saga

```jsx
// Generator in the LoginSaga
// Waits for the Login button press
export function * watchLoginAttempt () {
    // daemonize
    while (true) {
      // wait for LOGIN_ATTEMPT actions to arrive
      const { username, password } = yield take(Types.LOGIN_ATTEMPT)
      // call attemptLogin to perform the actual work
      yield call(attemptLogin, username, password)
    }
  }
```
